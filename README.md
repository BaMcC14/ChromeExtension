Chrome Extension README
_______________________________________

This is a simple Chrome Extension used to save URL's.
The extension can take user input or pull the url from the current chrome tab.
  - Single Click 
      SAVE INPUT
      SAVE TAB
  - Double Click
      Delete All 

The URL is displayed within the extension 
URL's are stored in local storage and will maintain from tab to tab

With this project I was able to work with 
  * const
  * addEventListener()
  * innerHTML
  * input.value
  * function parameters
  * template strings
  * localStorage
  * The JSON object
  * object in arrays
